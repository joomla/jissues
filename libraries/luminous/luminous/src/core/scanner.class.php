 * @brief The base scanner classes
 *
 * This file contains the base scanning classes. All language scanners should
 * subclass one of these. They are all essentially abstract as far as Luminous
 * is concerned, but it may occasionally be useful to instantiate one.
 *
 * The classes defined here follow a simple hierarchy: Scanner defines basic
 * string scanning methods, LuminousScanner extends this with logic useful to
 * highlighting. LuminousEmbeddedWebScript adds some helpers for web languages,
 * which may be nested in other languages. LuminousSimpleScanner is a
 * generic flat scanner which is driven by token rules.
 * LuminousStatefulScanner is a generic transition table driven scanner.

/**
 * @brief Base string scanning class
 *
 * The Scanner class is the base class which handles traversing a string while
 * searching for various different tokens.
 * It is loosely based on Ruby's StringScanner.
 *
 * The rough idea is we keep track of the position (a string pointer) and
 * use scan() to see what matches at the current position.
 *
 * It also provides some automation methods, but it's fairly low-level as
 * regards string scanning.
 *
 * Scanner is abstract as far as Luminous is concerned. LuminousScanner extends
 * Scanner significantly with some methods which are useful for recording
 * highlighting related data.

 *    @li 1:   Token string (e.g. '// foo')
 *    @li 2:   escaped? (bool) Because it's often more convenient to embed nested

/**
 *
 * @brief Experimental transition table driven scanner
 *
 * The stateful scanner follows a transition table and generates a hierarchical
 * token tree. As such, the states follow a hierarchical parent->child
 * relationship rather than a strict from->to
 *
 * A node in the token tree looks like this:
 *
 * @code array('token_name' => 'name','children' => array(...)) @endcode
 *
 * Children is an ordered list and its elements may be either other token
 * nodes or just strings. We override tagged to try to collapse this into XML
 * while still applying filters.
 *
 *
 * We now store patterns as the following tuple:
 * @code ($name, $open_pattern, $teminate_pattern). @endcode
 * The termination pattern may be null, in which case the $open_pattern
 * is complete. No transitions can occur within a complete state because
 * the patterns' match is fixed.
 *
 * We have two stacks. One is LuminousStatefulScanner::$token_tree_stack,
 * which stores the token tree, and the other is a standard state stack which
 * stores the current state data. State data is currently a pattern, as the
 * above tuple.
 *
 *
 * @warning Currently 'stream filters' are not applied, because we at no point
 * end up with a flat stream of tokens. Although the rule name remapper is
 * applied.
