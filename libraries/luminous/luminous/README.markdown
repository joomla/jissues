supports a bunch of common languages and output to HTML and LaTeX.

__Please don't clone the repo unless you have a good reason to.__ 
Instead, get a packaged version from the site linked below - this will ensure
you don't get masses of testing code and won't risk publicly exposing
resource heavy testing scripts and stuff.

Installation
============
Extract your tarball, zip, whatever, into some directory where it's going to be
used (i.e. probably your web-server).  We'll assume it's called `luminous/'

Quick Usage 
===========

First, if you're going to use caching, which you probably are, create a 
directory called luminous/cache and give it writable permissions (chmod 777 on
most servers -- yours may accept a less permissive value). Then include
luminous/luminous.php and away you go!

```php
<?php
require_once 'luminous/luminous.php';
echo luminous::head_html(); // outputs CSS includes, intended to go in <head>
echo luminous::highlight('c', 'printf("hello world\n");');
```

Useful examples can be found in luminous/examples/. If you have problems,
check that luminous/examples/example.php works.


Command Line Usage
==================

If you're crazy and want to use Luminous/PHP on the command line, guess what,
you can!

```bash
$ cd luminous/
$ php luminous.php --help
```
Polite Warning
================

Luminous is pretty slow. It's perfectly usable for highlighting several-KB
snippets on a blog or similar, and it also caches so highlighting is a
one-time overhead. Throughput is roughly 50-200 KB/s depending on the
language. In *most* use cases, this is easily fast enough, especially once you
consider that highlights are cached and therefore there is no real penalty
most of the time. You may need to run your own tests to decide whether or not
it is suitable for you.

## Caching 
The cache can be stored either directly on the file system or in a MySQL table
(support for other DBMSs will come later, patches welcome). In either case,
check out the [cache documentation](http://luminous.asgaard.co.uk/index.php/docs/show/cache).

Licensing
=========

Luminous is distributed under the GPL3 but includes a bunch of stuff which is
separate.

  - Everything under src/ and languages/ is part of Luminous.
  - Everything under tests/regression/*/* is real source code taken from various
      projects, which is used only as test data. It is all GPL-compatible, but
      is distributed under its own license. This directory is only present in
      the git repository and is not part of any stable distribution archives.
  - We also include jQuery and the vera-mono font family (client/font/). 
    These are provided under their own licenses.
