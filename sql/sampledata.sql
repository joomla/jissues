It would be up to any Joomla extension to load it with the following code:\r<br>JHtml::_(''load'', ''jquery'');\r<br>\r<br>The reason for creating a plugin is to avoid all of the support that the Joomla team would have to do by supporting another JS library.\r<br>I think this is a great solution for a problem that many developers have been trying to overcome for years.\r<br>\r<br>Please review and comment.\r<br>\r<br>Cheers,\r<br>Rafael', 3, 0, 1, '2012-02-02 18:36:55', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/116.diff', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This is being done because Joomla currently loads all of the JavaScript files first, then loads all of the JavaScript declarations afterwards.

There are two workarounds we could pursue:<br><br>* Manually add `jQuery.noConflict();` at the end of jquery.min.js. We would have to do this every time we update jQuery. This is what WordPress does.<br>* Add new code to `JDocument` and `JDocumentRenderer` that would allow declarations to be added immediately before or after a script is loaded.
