With the current logic an insert will be attempted and this results in a 500.</p>\n\n<h2>The fix</h2>\n\n<p>This fix uses a SELECT COUNT to determine a session row currently exists and should be updated.</p>\n\n<h2>Example Error</h2>\n\n<pre>\n500 - JDatabaseMySQLi::query: 1062 - Duplicate entry ''e33c3ab2b05a9dc97dc25187a823b8e6'' for key ''PRIMARY'' SQL=INSERT INTO `jos_session` (`session_id`, `data`, `time`) VALUES (''e33c3ab2b05a9dc97dc25187a823b8e6'', ''__default|a:8:{s:22:\\"session.client.browser\\";s:119:\\"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_8) AppleWebKit/535.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/18.0.1025.54 Safari/535.19\\";s:15:\\"session.counter\\";i:43;s:8:\\"registry\\";O:9:\\"JRegistry\\":1:{s:7:\\"\\0*\\0data\\";O:8:\\"stdClass\\":0:{}}s:4:\\"user\\";O:5:\\"JUser\\":23:{s:9:\\"\\0*\\0isRoot\\";b:0;s:2:\\"id\\";i:0;s:4:\\"name\\";N;s:8:\\"username\\";N;s:5:\\"email\\";N;s:8:\\"password\\";N;s:14:\\"password_clear\\";s:0:\\"\\";s:8:\\"usertype\\";N;s:5:\\"block\\";N;s:9:\\"sendEmail\\";i:0;s:12:\\"registerDate\\";N;s:13:\\"lastvisitDate\\";N;s:10:\\"activation\\";N;s:6:\\"params\\";N;s:6:\\"groups\\";a:0:{}s:5:\\"guest\\";i:1;s:10:\\"\\0*\\0_params\\";O:9:\\"JRegistry\\":1:{s:7:\\"\\0*\\0data\\";O:8:\\"stdClass\\":0:{}}s:14:\\"\\0*\\0_authGroups\\";a:1:{i:0;i:1;}s:14:\\"\\0*\\0_authLevels\\";a:2:{i:0;i:1;i:1;i:1;}s:15:\\"\\0*\\0_authActions\\";N;s:12:\\"\\0*\\0_errorMsg\\";N;s:10:\\"\\0*\\0_errors\\";a:0:{}s:3:\\"aid\\";i:0;}s:13:\\"session.token\\";s:32:\\"cc3f66462deb72a899115b2ea51f8608\\";s:19:\\"session.timer.start\\";i:1331743210;s:18:\\"session.timer.last\\";i:1331744856;s:17:\\"session.timer.now\\";i:1331744857;}'', ''1331744857'')\n</pre>', 3, 0, 1, '2012-03-14 17:13:53', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2012-12-01 14:03:00', 'https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/154.diff'),

This is being done because Joomla currently loads all of the JavaScript files first, then loads all of the JavaScript declarations afterwards. If you load jQuery, then MooTools (or another file that pre-defines <code>$</code>), then call <code>jQuery.noConflict()</code>, it will not work: <a href="http://www.designvsdevelop.com/jquery-in-joomla-i-was-wrong/">http://www.designvsdevelop.com/jquery-in-joomla-i-was-wrong/</a></p>\n\n<p>This approach works, but it is sub-optimal as you have to incur the overhead of two HTTP requests. There are two workarounds we could pursue:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Manually add <code>jQuery.noConflict();</code> at the end of jquery.min.js. We would have to do this every time we update jQuery. This is what WordPress does.</li>\n<li>Add new code to <code>JDocument</code> and <code>JDocumentRenderer</code> that would allow declarations to be added immediately before or after a script is loaded. (I believe <a href="https://github.com/beat" class="user-mention">@beat</a> mentioned he had a pull request for this on the platform)</li>\n</ul><p>Another thing we may want to consider is adding an option in Joomla that will let you specify a CDN copy of jQuery to use in place of the local one.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 4 June</strong>: The latest commits now implement code in <code>JDocument</code> for "post script" functionality. This allows inline JavaScript to be added immediately after a linked script. These commits also make it possible to specify an alternative path through <code>JHTML::_(''behavior.jquery'')</code>. This alternate path can be another copy of jQuery on the server, or the full URL to a CDN copy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 18 June</strong>: Prescript functionality has been added, exactly the same as "post script", just before the script loads instead of after.

Values for the <code>if</code> attribute can be one of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>"eq" equal to (default)</li>\n<li>"ge" - greater than or equal to</li>\n<li>"gt" - greater than</li>\n</ul><p>The <code>version</code> tag MAY include a <code>tested_date</code> attribute indicating the date the developer tested the specific version.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>version</code> tag MAY include a <code>message</code> attribute.  This is generally only used when under the <code>exclude</code> tag.</p>\n\n<p>The body of the <code>version</code> tag MUST be a string compatible with PHPs <code>version_compare</code> method.  The string MUST be in the form:</p>\n\n<p><code>X[.Y[.Z]]</code></p>\n\n<p>where:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>X is the major version (MUST be supplied)</li>\n<li>Y is the minor version (MAY be supplied)</li>\n<li>Z is the maintenance version (MAY be supplied)</li>\n</ul><p>If only the X is specified, the comparison (governed by the <code>if</code> attribute) is made against the major version only.  Any value of the minor version will be deemed compatible.</p>\n\n<p>If both X and Y are specified, the comparison major version must match, and the comparison is made against the minor version.  Any value of the maintenance version will be deemed compatible.</p>\n\n<p>If X, Y and Z are specified, the major and minor versions must match and the comparison is made against the maintenance version .</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following examples of the <code>version</code> tag:</p>\n\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>2<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The major part of the target version must be greater than or equal to 2 (<code>if</code> defaults to "eq").  A values such as 2.5 would pass.  Values of 1.5 or 3.0.1 would not pass.</p>\n\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>2.5<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The major part of the target version must match 2 and the minor part of the target version must be equal to 5.  Values such as 2.5.0 or 2.5.6 would pass.  Values such as 2.4, 2.6 or 3.0.0 would fail.</p>\n\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>2.5.1<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The target version must be 2.5.1.</p>\n\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;version</span> <span class="na">if=</span><span class="s">"ge"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>2.5.1<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Both the major and minor parts of the target version must match 2.5, and the maintenance part of the target version must be greater than or equal to 1.  Values such as 2.5.1, 2.5.2 and 2.5.99 would pass.  Values such as 2.5.0, 2.6 and 3.5.1 would fail.</p>\n\n<h2>Including and excluding versions</h2>\n\n<p>If a match is made on any <code>version</code> tag within the <code>exclude</code> tag, the compatibility check MUST fail. </p>\n\n<p>If a match is made on any <code>version</code> tag within the <code>include</code> tag, the compatibility check WILL pass providing it has not already failed due to the <code>exclude</code> tag.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following examples.</p>\n\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;extension&gt;</span>\n  <span class="nt">&lt;compatibility&gt;</span>\n    <span class="nt">&lt;include&gt;</span>\n      <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>2.5<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>\n      <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>3<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>\n    <span class="nt">&lt;/include&gt;</span>\n    <span class="nt">&lt;exclude&gt;</span>\n      <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>2.5.1<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>\n    <span class="nt">&lt;/exclude&gt;</span>\n  <span class="nt">&lt;/compatibility&gt;</span>\n<span class="nt">&lt;/extension&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>In this example any value of 2.5.* is compatible except 2.5.1, and any value of 3 is compatible.</p>\n\n<h2>General usage</h2>\n\n<p>The most common initial usage will be to establish whether a Joomla 2.5 web site can be upgrade to Joomla 3.  An extension developer will generally put in the following <code>compatibility</code> tag if they are confident the extension works on both 2.5 and any version of 3.  This provides the most permissive, practical option if the developer.</p>\n\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;extension&gt;</span>\n  <span class="nt">&lt;compatibility</span> <span class="na">url=</span><span class="s">"http://example.com/compatibility.html"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>\n    <span class="nt">&lt;include&gt;</span>\n      <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>2.5<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>\n      <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>3<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>\n    <span class="nt">&lt;/include&gt;</span>\n  <span class="nt">&lt;/compatibility&gt;</span>\n<span class="nt">&lt;/extension&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The disadvantage of the previous code is that it does elevate the risk of the user.  For developer that does not want users to automatically upgrade to Joomla 3.1 without them having a change to check the code, they should consider the following:</p>\n\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;extension&gt;</span>\n  <span class="nt">&lt;compatibility</span> <span class="na">url=</span><span class="s">"http://example.com/compatibility.html"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>\n    <span class="nt">&lt;include&gt;</span>\n      <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>2.5<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>\n      <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>3.0<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>\n    <span class="nt">&lt;/include&gt;</span>\n  <span class="nt">&lt;/compatibility&gt;</span>\n<span class="nt">&lt;/extension&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>In the event you need to specify a minimum current version, but still allow upgrading to the next minor version, the following strategy could be used:</p>\n\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;extension&gt;</span>\n  <span class="nt">&lt;compatibility</span> <span class="na">url=</span><span class="s">"http://example.com/compatibility.html"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>\n    <span class="nt">&lt;include&gt;</span>\n      <span class="nt">&lt;version</span>

class="nt">&lt;/compatibility&gt;</span>\n<span class="nt">&lt;/extension&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The following complex example could be typical when nearing the release of Joomla 4.</p>\n\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;extension&gt;</span>\n  <span class="nt">&lt;compatibility</span> <span class="na">url=</span><span

Both the Platform and CMS are now PHP 5 so unless a method is declared statically, you should not use it that way (in Eclipse, the code-assist will only show methods explicitly declared static when used in that context). An example of how you can use JView in a module can be found here:</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://github.com/eddieajau/joomla-hello-world/blob/master/modules/mod_hello/mod_hello.php">https://github.com/eddieajau/joomla-hello-world/blob/master/modules/mod_hello/mod_hello.php</a></p>\n\n<p>[ if you sign up for my training I''ll explain why  :) ] </p>\n\n<p>In practice you wouldn''t include the class in the module file but in it''s own file and then use a require_once statement or, better, register the class with JLoader::register.  It''s a bit rough but it gets the job done.  As I explain in my training, the major advantage in doing it this way is that you design layouts for components and modules in the same way so you get the escape method and also cool things like $this-&gt;baseurl, etc.  There are some Easter eggs in the layout of that example module as well, but I''ll leave you to find them :)</p>\n\n<p>As for a recommendation, I''m agnostic about whether you use JView or just apply a quick fix with htmlspecialchars.

However, after review, I see that the files are actually included which, in my thinking anyway, implies the same degree of support for jQuery as is provided for Mootools. </p>\n\n<p>I think your registration concept is on the right track, but not the plugin, nor the inclusion of jQuery. I''d encourage you to beef up the API a bit and include a version, as Beat is indicating. Then, make certain the API provides adequate interface for extension devs to determine whether or not files exist that can simply be reused, or the extension needs to load those files. Nothing more than that, though, IMO.</p>\n\n<p>It would be great to see the administrator template bundling the UI layer with the CSS, etc., whether it''s Bootstrap and jQuery, or MTs and Mocha, it''s more of a frontend developer choice and a adopting a JS-agnostic goal to help keep those options open will be very helpful for Joomla users. </p>', '2012-02-03 16:48:30'),

This way developers can just add the jquery library from their extension, but not override it in case the jquery plugin is already enabled.</li>\n<li>Honestly, I don''t even this is necessary, it adds unnecessary overhead. Joomla doesn''t maintain old versions of other javascript libraries, nor does it allow you to load old versions of mootools. You are stuck with the version that it ships with, and I think that fine. It is best to keep up with the latest and greatest. As another note, jquery is much better about backwards compatibility than other libraries.</li>\n<li>The plugin would need to get accepted by the CMS, but I would also need to submit a pull request for the platform changes.

Right now, the MooTools Boostrap port mentioned above is three patches behind the standard version of Bootstrap. Also, although we''re not using it in this case, the MooTools port of Backbone is currently one patch behind the standard version.</p>\n\n<p>Another concern is that MooTools ports are often incomplete. This is the case with the Bootstrap port: the ScrollSpy functionality is not supported. I''m assuming that there''s more ported over than the <a href="http://anutron.github.com/mootools-bootstrap/">http://anutron.github.com/mootools-bootstrap/</a> suggests, but it appears as though there may be quite a bit missing when you compare to the original.</p>\n\n<p>The markup for MooTools Boostrap is also different from the original. MooTools Bootstrap uses data attributes to assign behaviors to HTML elements, where the original does not. Part of the advantage of using something like Bootstrap is that someone coming from outside of the Joomla world will be able to use a familiar tool immediately. When we break that by using a slightly different variant, we''re making it more difficult for people to adopt Joomla.</p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, MooTools Bootstrap is not preferable.</p>\n\n<p>This pull request makes it possible for jQuery and MooTools to properly coexist on the same page, so adding jQuery shouldn''t be a problem.</p>', '2012-06-10 18:58:57'),
(6230987, 218, 'nikosdion', '<p>I agree with Joe that there is no point adding anything else except the original (jQuery-based) version of Bootstrap. Besides, if we are using a popular CDN like Google''s to deliver the jQuery and MooTools JavaScript files then there is no point discussing performance. Since so many sites out there already use the same files from the same CDNs there''s a big chance that these files are already in the cache of the visitor''s browser cache. IMHO, we Joomla! extensions developers are causing a much bigger pain in the rear of webmasters and web visitors alike since each one of us has to load his own private, namespaced copy of jQuery on a page. Usually with a system plugin. On every page. Ugh! Having One True Solution(tm) for loading jQuery off a CDN would let us allow Joomla! users build faster loading sites while at the same time using all the power of mooTools and rapid development of jQuery.</p>', '2012-06-10 19:12:24'),

You can use either with data attributes or without. (Kyle chose with BTW)</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://github.com/nikosdion" class="user-mention">@nikosdion</a> <br>\nI''m eagerly awaiting the complains of developers when the CMS ships an incompatible jQuery version ;) Look at wordpress where you end up with 2-3 jQuery versions when you''re unlucky. IIRC Beat mentioned he can''t update the jQuery version in Community Builder because CB plug-ins rely on it. I''m not totally against including jQuery into the core (I''m against using it in the core thou) I just hope people realize it''s not a magic bullet to solve their jQuery problems.</p>\n\n<p>As for the performance question. The browser still has to execute two big libraries on each request (think mobile). As much as it pains me to say but it would make far more sense to just switch the complete thing to jQuery than to deal with two libraries.</p>\n\n<p>As for the CDN argument, I''m not quite sold on that and hard stats are almost impossible to come by. Browser caches are by default surprisingly small (Opera 20MB, Firefox 50MB). Considering the different CDN providers, jQuery versions (21 hosted by Google by my count), etc. the chance it''s in the cache is certainly far higher than a local version but I''m not sure it''s as high as most people think it is. That''s not to say it''s not a good idea to use it - but I don''t think ti''s good enough to justify loading an additional 80KB.</p>', '2012-06-10 19:55:53'),

I somehow managed to update all of my jQuery, most of which I have written over two years ago and can''t explain you how it works even if you held me at gunpoint. In other words, there is nothing impossible. It''s merely a question of ROI. If the net gain (faster site, less compatibility issues) outweighs the drawbacks (rewriting code, rare cases of workarounds to support multiple versions) developers will follow suit. If we were just negatively predisposed individuals we would have never worked on making our software compatible with Joomla! 2.x ;)</p>\n\n<p>Regarding performance. I have only used Joomla! websites on iPad 2, iPhone 4S and HTC Desire (1GHz single and dual core processors). In all cases the bottleneck on mobile is the download weight, especially on 3G connections due to the huge lag. All of my devices didn''t even blink parsing jQuery and mooTools. But, yes, if we could get Joomla!''s own JS to be jQuery based it would be slightly better.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding CDNs, I agree with you. But! The more sites using the same file from the same CDN the more likely is the browser caching the file. I will tell you my unscientific, very objective findings so far. Ever since I had Kickstart load jQuery off a CDN people have been telling me how much faster it is. It would be interesting to have analytics about that, but I have no idea where to look or start.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, even if the cache was busted and we ended up loading one copy of jQuery during the user''s first visit it would still be better than the typical site I see today. In the typical site we have at least two extensions loading two different jQuery versions. In this case, 80Kb with a single HTTP request guaranteed to get cached in the following page loads is better than 2 * 80Kb HTTP requests which most usually won''t get cached because there is neither an Expires not an Etag header. Of course if someone is merely using stock Joomla! it will make the page slightly heavier, by 80Kb. Well, we do get the option, as extension developers, to choose whether we want to load jQuery, don''t we?</p>', '2012-06-10 20:10:56'),

I stand corrected.</p>\n\n<p>I believe the plan is to get as much of the frontend core JavaScript converted to jQuery as possible first. This way, MooTools won''t be required to load and can be pulled in on an as-needed basis. If we can get everything converted over to jQuery for Joomla 3.0, that would be ideal, but it might also be too aggressive of a timeline.</p>\n\n<p>Long term, MooTools will most likely continue to be available in core for legacy code, just pulled in only when necessary. Obviously, having two libraries load is not ideal, but we can make an effort to ensure it isn''t the norm.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, there will always be people out there shipping code relying on out of date versions of jQuery, no matter how much we beg for people to upgrade. There are indeed no silver bullets, but having one specific copy available in core will definitely encourage people to avoid including their own.</p>', '2012-06-10 20:13:06'),

As i understand it (the official spec isn''t an easy read) it is also not really the case that there is a default value for these assets (not just js), instead the browser checks what type the file is and proceeds on that basis. The browser checks whatever the case.</p>\n\n<p>Thus declaring an incorrect type attribute should not work because the browser will determine the file type and ignore the type attribute.

Sane browsers (which means all but IE, IE can be forced to this behavior with a HTTP header) don''t sniff for content.</p>\n\n<p>The HTML5 spec says for the type element on the link element:</p>\n\n<pre><code>For external resource links, the type attribute is used as a hint to user agents so that they can avoid fetching resources they do not support. If the attribute is present, then the user agent must assume that the resource is of the given type (even if that is not a valid MIME type, e.g. the empty string). If the attribute is omitted, but the external resource link type has a default type defined, then the user agent must assume that the resource is of that type. If the UA does not support the given MIME type for the given link relationship, then the UA should not obtain the resource; if the UA does support the given MIME type for the given link relationship, then the UA should obtain the resource at the appropriate time as specified for the external resource link''s particular type. If the attribute is omitted, and the external resource link type does not have a default type defined, but the user agent would obtain the resource if the type was known and supported, then the user agent should obtain the resource under the assumption that it will be supported.\n\nUser agents must not consider the type attribute authoritative — upon fetching the resource, user agents must not use the type attribute to determine its actual type. Only the actual type (as defined in the next paragraph) is used to determine whether to apply the resource, not the aforementioned assumed type.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>By obtaining the actual type is not content sniffing meant but relying on the <code>Content-Type</code> header.</p>\n\n<p>For the script element (which is more relevant because it gets trickier):</p>\n\n<pre><code>The type attribute gives the language of the script or format of the data. If the attribute is present, its value must be a valid MIME type. The charset parameter must not be specified. The default, which is used if the attribute is absent, is "text/javascript".\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And for information why content sniffing is not a good thing I recommend: <a href="http://www.h-online.com/security/features/Risky-MIME-sniffing-in-Internet-Explorer-746229.html">http://www.h-online.com/security/features/Risky-MIME-sniffing-in-Internet-Explorer-746229.html</a></p>', '2012-08-18 21:18:35'),

For javascript maybe an in_array with all the javascript types commonly used (text/javascript is the default type in HTML5 but is marked as obsolete by IANA that recommends application/javascript ....that doesn''t work on IE9..... ). So for example something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    // Generate script file links\n    foreach ($document-&gt;_scripts as $strSrc =&gt; $strAttr)\n    {\n        $buffer .= $tab .

However, we also know many developers don''t follow the "Joomla way" and it''s only a matter of time until their stuff screws up.  There are any number of reasons why an extension could "break" when going from, for example, 3.1 to 3.2 and it may not have to do with backward compatibility.  The point of the RFC is, in addressing compatibility checks, to force the developer to rate their extension for each minor version.  This IS a reasonable expectation a Joomla CMS user might have.</p>\n\n<p>Also, consider this.  You have an extension.  It''s popular but your major competitor is far more popular - no matter what you do the <a href="https://github.com/JTracker/jissues/issues/1" class="issue-link" title="Sorting and Filtering options">#1</a> spot on the JED eludes you.
