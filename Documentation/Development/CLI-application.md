## CLI - Command Line Application

The script is located at `/bin/jtracker` and is meant to be executed on the computers [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

This script will do:

* Setup the required database for the application.
* Initial import and further update of issues and issue comments from GitHub.
* Lots of other functionality for maintaining the application in sync and generate lots of useful stuff.

Usage:

`jtracker <command> [action]`

See: `jtracker help` for more information.
Or: `jtracker help <command>` for more information on a specific command.

### Install the application

Copy `/etc/config.dist.json` to `/etc/config.json` and fill in your database details. To interface with GitHub, fill in your GitHub credentials.

Then run:
	`jtracker install`

### Import a project from GitHub

The command `jtracker get project` will retrieve the information for a given project from GitHub.
This should be used during installation and periodical executions.

To bypass inputs and write the output to a log file during cron execution, a similar command could be used:

`jtracker get:project -p 2 --all --status=all --quiet --noprogress --log cron.log`

*Note* `get:project` will "batch run" the available `get` commands in the correct (..erm) order.

### Colors

The Joomla! Framework's command line application class supports the display of colorful output on ANSI enabled terminals and the issue tracker makes use of this.

ANSI color codes are supported in most (if not all) *nix style terminals.
Windows support was tested from a virtual machine running Windows XP with Git for Windows and GitHub for Windows (both include terminals) but neither those nor the standard Windows command prompt supported ANSI colors.
Then [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) was installed and produced the following output:

![win-colors1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/33978/491726/2c5ff9b4-ba54-11e2-80eb-76a29914d58a.png)

### Progress Bar

Since there are some long running operations (over 10 minutes pulling the CMS' issues), we use the Joomla Console Package progress bar.

### Unsupported...

If your terminal does not support ANSI control codes you may see something like this:

![win-colors-fail](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/33978/491728/57cc233e-ba54-11e2-9c6b-154ad99488fd.png)

### Turn it off !

To suppress color output for a single command use the `--no-ansi` switch.
To suppress the progress bar for a single command use the `--noprogress` switch.
Example:
`jtracker get project --no-ansi --noprogress`

To turn the feature(s) off permanently edit `etc/config.json` and set the values for the undesired features from `1` to `0`.

### Auto Complete

Auto complete files are provided for some environments.

#### PhpStorm

If you use PhpStorm, you may use the [Command Line Tools Console](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/webhelp/command-line-tools-console-tool-window.html) to execute the jtracker script.

To get auto complete for the `jtracker` commands, copy the file `Custom_jtracker.xml` to the folder `.idea/commandlinetools` inside your JTracker project (create the folder if it does not exist). This will set up an alias `jt` that points to the `/bin/jtracker` script.

Don't miss the documentation - Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd>

#### The `fish` shell

Provides auto complete for users of the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com).

To use it, copy (or better symlink) the file 
`{repo}/cli/completions/jtracker.fish`
to
`~/.config/fish/completions/`
and restart your shell.

Works in PHPStorms "Terminal".

And of course in your favourite terminal too.

Happy auto completing `=;)`
